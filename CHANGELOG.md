# Changelog

## 0.6.0 - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **GitHub Copilot provider.** Parses `~/.copilot/session-state/*/events.jsonl`
  and tracks model changes via `session.model_change` events. Picks up six new
  model prices (`gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4.1-nano`, `gpt-5-mini`, `o3`,
  `o4-mini`). Contributed by @theodorosD. Note: Copilot logs only output
  tokens, so cost rows will sit below actual API cost.
- **All Time period (key `5`).** Shows every recorded session since CodeBurn
  started tracking. Daily Activity expands to every available day instead of
  the fixed 14- or 31-day window. `codeburn report -p all` also works from
  the CLI. Contributed by @lfl1337.
- **avg/s column in By Project.** Average cost per session next to the
  existing total cost and session count. Surfaces projects where individual
  sessions are expensive even if the total is modest. Contributed by @lfl1337.
- **Top Sessions panel.** Highlights the five most expensive sessions across
  all projects with date, project, cost, and API call count. Helps spot
  outliers that drag weekly or monthly totals. Contributed by @lfl1337.

### Fixed
- `modelDisplayName` now matches longest key first so `gpt-4.1-mini` resolves
  to `GPT-4.1 Mini` instead of `GPT-4.1`.
- `TopSessions` handles missing `firstTimestamp` gracefully with a
  `----------` placeholder instead of rendering a stray whitespace row.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Cursor IDE support.** Reads token usage from Cursor's local SQLite
  database. Shows activity classification, model breakdown, and a Languages
  panel extracted from code blocks. Costs estimated using Sonnet pricing for
  Auto mode (labeled clearly). Supports macOS, Linux, and Windows paths.
- SQLite adapter with lazy-loaded `better-sqlite3` (optional dependency).
  Claude Code and Codex users are completely unaffected if it is not installed.
- File-based result cache for Cursor. First run parses the database (can take
  up to a minute on very large databases); subsequent runs load from cache
  in under 250ms. Cache auto-invalidates when Cursor modifies the database.
- Provider-specific dashboard layout. Cursor shows a Languages panel instead
  of Core Tools, Shell Commands, and MCP Servers (Cursor does not log these).
- Provider color coding in the dashboard tab bar (Claude: orange, Codex: green,
  Cursor: cyan).
- Broader activity classification patterns: file extensions, script references,
  URLs, and HTTP status codes now trigger more accurate categories.
- Debounced period switching. Arrow keys wait 600ms before loading data so
  quickly scrolling through periods skips intermediate loads. Number keys
  still load immediately.
- Dynamic version reading from package.json (no more hardcoded version string).

### Fixed
- CLI `--version` reported stale 0.4.1 since v0.4.2. Closes #38.

## 0.4.4 - 2026-04-15

### Added
- Auto-refresh flag. `codeburn report --refresh 60` reloads data at a set
  interval. Works on `report`, `today`, and `month` commands. Default off.
- Readable project names. Strips home directory prefix from encoded paths,
  shows 3 path segments for more context. Home dir sessions display as "home".
- Responsive dashboard reflows on terminal resize via Ink's useWindowSize
  hook. Width cap raised from 104 to 160 columns. Contributed by @AleBles.
- Total downloads and install size badges in README.

### Fixed
- Agent/subagent session files were excluded, dropping ~46% of API calls.
  Subagent sessions live in separate subagents/ directories with unique
  message IDs and are now included. Closes #17.
- Codex cache hit always showed 100%. OpenAI includes cached tokens inside
  input_tokens (unlike Anthropic). Normalized to prevent double-counting
  in cost calculation and cache hit display. Closes #21.
- CSV formula injection. Cells starting with =, +, -, @ are prefixed with
  an apostrophe before CSV escaping. Contributed by @serabi.
- Menubar "Open Full Report" and "Export CSV" actions broken for npm-installed
  users. Invokes resolved binary directly instead of assuming ~/codeburn
  checkout. Currency picker used nonexistent `config currency` subcommand.
  Contributed by @MukundaKatta. Closes #32, #27.
- Activity panel moved from full-width to half-width row for better space
  usage on wide terminals.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Multi-currency support. `codeburn currency GBP` sets display currency (162 ISO
  4217 codes). Exchange rates from Frankfurter API (ECB data, 24h cache). Applies
  to dashboard, status, menubar, and exports. Contributed by @BlairWelsh.
- 30-day rolling window period (`codeburn report -p 30days`, key `3` in TUI).
  Distinct from calendar month. Contributed by @oysteinkrog.
- Menubar currency picker with 17 common currencies.

### Fixed
- Export "30 Days" period now uses actual 30-day range instead of calendar month.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Codex (OpenAI) support. Parses sessions from ~/.codex/sessions/ with full
  token tracking, cost calculation, task classification, and tool breakdown.
- Provider plugin system. Adding a new provider (Pi, OpenCode, Amp) is a
  single file in src/providers/.
- TUI provider toggle. Press p to cycle All / Claude / Codex. Auto-detects
  which providers have session data on disk. Hidden when only one is present.
- --provider flag on all CLI commands: report, today, month, status, export.
  Values: all (default), claude, codex.
- Codex tool normalization: exec_command -> Bash, read_file -> Read,
  write_file/apply_diff/apply_patch -> Edit, spawn_agent -> Agent.
- Codex model pricing: gpt-5, gpt-5.3-codex, gpt-5.4, gpt-5.4-mini with
  hardcoded fallbacks to prevent LiteLLM fuzzy matching mispricing.
- CODEX_HOME environment variable support for custom Codex data directories.
- Menubar per-provider cost breakdown when multiple providers have data.
- 1-minute in-memory cache with LRU eviction for instant provider switching.
- 10 new tests (Codex parser, provider registry, tool/model mapping).

### Fixed
- Model name fuzzy matching: gpt-5.4-mini no longer mispriced as gpt-5
  (more specific prefixes checked first).

## 0.3.1 - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Shell Commands breakdown panel showing which CLI binaries are used most
  (git, npm, docker, etc.). Parses compound commands (&&, ;, |) and handles
  quoted strings. Contributed by @rafaelcalleja.

### Changed
- Activity panel is now full-width so the 1-shot column renders cleanly
  on all terminal sizes.

### Fixed
- Crash on unreadable session files (ENOENT). Skips gracefully instead.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-04-14

### Added
- One-shot success rate per activity category. Detects edit/test/fix retry
  cycles (Edit -> Bash -> Edit) within each turn. Shows 1-shot percentage
  in the By Activity panel for categories that involve code edits.

### Fixed
- Turn grouping: tool-result entries (type "user" with no text) no longer
  split turns. Previously inflated Conversation category by 3-5x at the
  expense of Coding, Debugging, and other edit-heavy categories.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Claude Desktop (code tab) session support. Scans local-agent-mode-sessions
  in addition to ~/.claude/projects/. Same JSONL format, deduplication across
  both sources. macOS, Windows, and Linux paths.
- CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR environment variable support. Falls back to ~/.claude if
  not set.

### Fixed
- npm package trimmed from 1.1MB to 41KB by adding files field (ships dist/
  only).
- Image URLs switched to jsDelivr CDN for npm readme rendering.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- Readme image URLs for npm rendering.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Interactive TUI dashboard built with Ink (React for terminals).
- 13-category task classifier (coding, debugging, exploration, brainstorming,
  etc.) using tool usage patterns and keyword matching. No LLM calls.
- Breakdowns by daily activity, project, model, task type, core tools, and
  MCP servers.
- Gradient bar charts (blue to amber to orange) inspired by btop.
- Responsive layout: side-by-side panels at 90+ cols, stacked below.
- Keyboard navigation: arrow keys switch Today/7 Days/Month, q to quit.
- Column headers on all panels.
- Bottom status bar with key hints (interactive mode only).
- Per-panel accent border colors with rounded corners.
- SwiftBar/xbar menu bar widget with flame icon, activity breakdown, model
  costs, and token stats. Refreshes every 5 minutes.
- CSV and JSON export with Today, 7 Days, and 30 Days periods.
- LiteLLM pricing integration with 24h cache and hardcoded fallback.
  Supports input, output, cache write, cache read, web search, and fast
  mode multiplier.
- Message deduplication by API message ID across all session files.
- Date-range filtering per entry (not per session) to prevent session bleed.
- Compact status command with terminal, menubar, and JSON output formats.
